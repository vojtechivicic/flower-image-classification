# Flower Image Classification
**Pytorch** implementation of an image classifier for identification of flower species using deep learning. It is trained on **102 flower categories** from [Oxford Flower Dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). To obtain higher accuracy of our model we take advantage of **transfer learning** with a **pretrained network**. 

The project is the final assigment for Udacity [PyTorch Scholarship Challenge](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship).
